# Dedicated Virtual Machine

## Virtualization Overview

Many CTF players will choose to run a virtualized environment specifically for competing and researching techniques. A major driven in this trend is Kali Linux, a penetration testing linux operating system which many information security professionals have heard of or interacted with at some point in their career. Kali Linux is maintained by Offensive Security, a security firm and organizers behind the Offensive Security Certified Professional \(OSCP\) certification exam . It's a popular choice among penetration testers and CTF players alike because of its pre-configured list of security tools and frameworks that make it easy to test a wide variety of security topics. 

## Choosing the right platform

The two main types of virtualized environments used for this purpose are VMWare and Virtual Machine. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. They both offer free community editions, which can be downloaded and installed on Windows or Mac OSX.
