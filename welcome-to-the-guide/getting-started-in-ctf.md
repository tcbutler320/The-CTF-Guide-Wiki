# What is Capture the Flag

## Overview

Capture the Flag competitions can come in several forms, but most commonly refers to challenges where players use techniques to exploit vulnerabilities to “capture” or reveal flags which are hidden from plain view. The practice of CTF’s helps to develop deep understanding of computer’s, computer networking, software, open source intelligence, and more. There are several different types of CTF events including [boot2root](../categories/boot-2-root/), Jeopardy, [Attack-Defense](../categories/attack-defend.md), OSINT, and mixed. Each type requires the use of slightly different skill sets, and can vary on exact format.

## The many faces of CTF

When it comes to actually competing in a CTF competition, there are a wide variety of topics that can be choose. Many CTFs are focused on challenges in information technology security, others do not require technical knowledge at all. Level of interaction with others also differs depending on the type of CTF. A Jeopardy competition hosted by a University might be held in large open auditoriums with hundreds or thousands of participants. Some jeopardy competitions are entirely virtual, and teams can decide to meet in small group to compete or work on challenges in a remote setting. Length of competitions can also vary. The National  Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition holds a championship CTF which takes place for 16 hours over the course of two days. In contrast, Boot 2 Root challenges have no expected time frame, and can be completed at the players leisure.

The National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition \(CCDC\) is an annual competition which offers a chance for college and post secondary students to compete against one another in an attack/defense style CTF competition. It is often regarded as the cornerstone of CTF competitions at the collegiate level, and a goal for many college teams to get a chance to compete for. It is hosted by The Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security \(CIAS\) at The University of Texas at San Antonio. It's format is a two day long defense scenario in which teams of 12 must protect essential application services from being taken offline by seasoned industry experts. 

> Scoring will be based on keeping required services up, controlling/preventing un-authorized access, and completing business tasks that will be provided throughout the competition. Teams accumulate points by successfully completing injects and maintaining services. Teams lose points by violating service level agreements, usage of recovery services, and successful penetrations by the Red Team. ~ [NCCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php/competition/competitors/rules)
