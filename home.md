Capture the Flag competitions can come in several forms, but most commonly refers to challenges where players use offensive cyber techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in software to “‘capture” or reveal flags which are hidden from plain view. The practice of CTF’s helps to develop deep understanding of computer’s, computer networking, software, and the relationship between them. There are several different types of CTF events including boot2root, Jeopardy, Attack-Defense, and mixed. Each type uses slightly different skill sets.

This CTF Playbook is a collection of resources for people looking to get involved in their first CTF as well as seasoned players looking for new solutions to challenges. The github wiki for the project hosts links to resources, snippets of code, CTF write-ups, and more.
