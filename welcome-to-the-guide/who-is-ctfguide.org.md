# Who is CTFGuide.org

The CTF Guide is a passion project started run and organized by Tyler Butler and started in 2020. As an information security technology professional, I am passionate about many topics, but high on the list is helping others by open-sourcing the information he has learned in his own personal infosec journey. 

As you may have noticed, The CTF Guide is currently hosted as a subdomain to Tyler's portfolio website at ctfguide.tylerbutler.io. As part of the roadmap for this project, The CTF Guide will eventually be moved to CTFGuide.org. 

If you are interested in learning more about the project, or contributing to the documentation you see here. Please reach out to Tyler at contact@ctfguide.org.
